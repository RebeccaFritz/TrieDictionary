This is a Trie implementation of the set interface which was coded as the final project for the University of Dallas Advanced Discrete Structures Class taught by Dr. David Andrews. 
The requirements were that the Trie class implement the Set<E> and Iterable<E> interfaces on Strings so that a large word dictionary could be read into the Trie and printed with Iterable.

The Main.java file, Set.java file, and the contains() method in the Trie.java file were written by Dr Andrews.
